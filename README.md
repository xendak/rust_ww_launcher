# rust_ww_launcher
Rust launcher for waves, switches between modded and default

on first launch it will prompt for the user to input the following folders & files:
mods_folder => it's the folder that contains your modded .pak and .sig files (i.e, rust_ww_launcher/mods)
game_folder => path to the game folder, not the binary (i.e, E:/Games/Wuthering Waves/Wuthering Waves Game)
modded_launcher => assumes you use a executable to launch the modded game version, you should probably include -fileopenlog

note, this is probably shit codded and useless? dunno, im just learning rust and tried to make something out of it.
